# Hire me

You have an idea for an awesome app? You have an existing app that has some issues or could be improved? Or maybe you have an app thank is going very well and you are not sure why?

If any of the above is true, you should [contact me](mailto:project@florianbuerger.com). I will help you to build out that idea, advise you how your app could be improved or help your engineering team with the implementation. 

I am available for iOS and Mac OS X development as well as any kind of software design consulting.

# Rates

My rate is $150 per hour for short term projects or smaller chunks of work. If you need more work done, we should talk. I'll require half down payment up font.

# Availability

Normally I am limited to 30 hours per week. More time may be available upon request.

Talk to my friends at [fortyone](http://fortyone.io) if you need more work done sooner.

# Legal

You need to sign my consulting agreement. It has an NDA agreement included. [Here is a sample](/share/sample-agreement.pdf) of what this agreement could look like.
