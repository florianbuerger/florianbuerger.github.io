title: Most software today is way to complicated

I believe interaction between computers and humans don’t have to be complicated and frustrating. Most software today does not account how users think and what they believe in. We can do better. We shouldn't strive to add feature after feature. Instead we must focus on the user and learn what she or he is expecting from our product and how we can fulfill their expectations.

I'd love to work on a project where I can solve real world problems using whatever technology is best suited for the job. I don't want to be limited to programming. I want to work on UI concepts, prototype different interactions and research how the potential user is operating.
