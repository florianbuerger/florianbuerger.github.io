I went for a run today and I didn’t take my iPhone with me. Normally I use Runkeeper to track my time, my distance, my pace and so on. But this time I didn’t. The only thing I did take with me were my keys. This run was the most pleasing running experience I had in a long time.

I saw the trail.

I saw the woods.

I took in my surroundings. There was no instructor voice in my earphones to tell me my average pace so far so I didn’t know if I was running slower or faster than before.

I didn’t know how long I was running.

I simply kept going as long as it felt comfortable, then I turned and ran back home. The whole time my head was filled with the sound of my shoes hitting the ground and my breathing. Nothing else.

It was the most disconnected feeling from the daily work I felt in a long time. It was amazing!
